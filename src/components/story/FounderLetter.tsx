                        That dream took root in something close to my heart: the
                        food from my hometown, <strong>Hải Phòng</strong>,
                        Vietnam. In Toronto, we noticed a real lack of authentic{" "}
                        <em>bánh mì que</em> and Vietnamese desserts. These were
                        the flavors I grew up with, and I wanted to share them.

                        We actually tested the idea first, selling homemade
                        desserts through Facebook groups. People loved it. For
                        the first time, we thought maybe, just maybe, we could
                        do something bigger. With all the savings we had, we
                        opened <strong>VietBites</strong>.

                            To introduce nostalgic, authentic flavors to locals
                            and passersby, and to give people a little taste of
                            Vietnam — just the way I remember it.

                        It hasn&apos;t been easy. As a first-time business
                        owner, we had to figure out everything—from designing
                        our own menu, to testing recipes, dealing with
                        landlords, even assembling furniture by hand. Every inch
                        of the shop was built with sweat, heart, and many
                        trials.

                        It&apos;s been tough, but also incredibly fun. Every
                        challenge reminded us why we started. Now, just weeks
                        after opening, we&apos;re still learning every day. But
                        seeing smiles on our guests&apos; faces and hearing how
                        much they love our bánh mì and desserts makes it all
                        worth it!
