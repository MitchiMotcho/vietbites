                    That dream took root in something close to my heart: the
                    food from my hometown, <strong>Hải Phòng</strong>, Vietnam.
                    In Toronto, we noticed a real lack of authentic{" "}
                    <em>bánh mì que</em> and Vietnamese desserts. These were the
                    flavors I grew up with, and I wanted to share them.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-4 text-base md:text-lg text-charcoal/90">
                    We actually tested the idea first, selling homemade desserts
                    through Facebook groups. People loved it. For the first
                    time, we thought maybe, just maybe, we could do something
                    bigger. With all the savings we had, we opened{" "}
                    <strong>VietBites</strong>.

                        Our mission is to introduce nostalgic, authentic flavors
                        to locals and passersby, and to give people a little
                        taste of Vietnam, just the way I remember it.

                    It hasn&apos;t been easy. As a first-time business owner, we
                    had to figure out everything—from designing our own menu, to
                    testing recipes, dealing with landlords, even assembling
                    furniture by hand. Every inch of the shop was built with
                    sweat, heart, and many trials.

                <p className="mt-4 text-base md:text-lg text-charcoal/90">
                    It&apos;s been tough, but also incredibly fun. Every
                    challenge reminded us why we started. Now, just weeks after
                    opening, we&apos;re still learning every day. But seeing
                    smiles on our guests&apos; faces and hearing how much they love
                    our bánh mì and desserts makes it all worth it!
